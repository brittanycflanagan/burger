# Burger Application

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 
* The app stores all burgers in a database, whether devoured or not.
* Once a burger has been "eaten", the user can decide to "remake the burger" (which moved the burger back to the left side of the page) or "throw away trash" (which removes the burger completely from the database)
